          <h3>WHERE DO I GO WHEN I GET THERE?</h3>
          <p>
            We have special parking spaces for you. Once you make your way onto our campus, look for the parking lot across from the main church building on Brookfield Avenue. This parking lot is reserved for guest parking.
            If you have any questions or need directions, there are people in blue vests and/or golf carts available to answer questions and help you find your way to the right place. If you have kids or infants, they will direct you to our children’s church locations.
          </p>
          <h3>WHAT IS THERE FOR ME?</h3>
          <p>
            On Saturday evenings, we have a 5:00 p.m. worship service at the BX. Following that service, you have the opportunity to take part in one of many Life Groups for anyone of any age group.

            On Sunday mornings, we have an 8:30 a.m. worship service both in the sanctuary and at the BX. Following that service, you have the opportunity to take part in one of many Life Groups for anyone of any age group. For those of you who aren’t morning people, there are also worship services in the sanctuary and at the BX that follow Life Groups at 11:15 a.m.

            We offer two different venues on our campus in which you can worship so that whether you’ve been in church all your life or never stepped foot in a church before, you feel comfortable joining us on a Sunday morning. You can learn more about them here.

          <h3>WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT WHEN I ARRIVE?</h3>
          <p>
            There are two check in areas. The preschool check in desk, for birth through 5 year olds, is located in the Bostick preschool building through the glass doors. The second check in station is for K5 through 5th and is located in the Undergound, at the end of the sidewalk that connects the sanctuary and the church gym. At each desk your child will receive a name tag that includes parent contact information and allergy information, if applicable. As a parent you will receive a matching security tag that identifies your child to you; you will need this tag to pick up your child. Your first week, the desk worker will guide you to your child’s age appropriate room and introduce you to your child’s teacher.
          </p>
          <h3>WHO IS TAKING CARE OF MY CHILD?</h3>
          <p>
            During Life Group hours, children will have the same volunteer teachers each week. During the worship service, preschool rooms have one paid worker as well as a volunteer and children’s groups have two to three volunteers per grade. Detailed background checks are done on Life Group teachers and paid workers and they each receive training on policies and procedures. Paid workers are also required to be CPR certified.
          </p>
          <h3>WILL MY CHILD BE FED?</h3>
          <p>
            We will be happy to give your infant or toddler a snack that you have provided. All liquids must be in a labeled plastic bottle or cup and the snack must be finger foods. Any special instructions can be listed on the infant/toddler gram provided outside of your child’s room. Goldfish and water are provided for children two years old through pre-k. Food allergies can be noted on the child’s security name tag. Those children will be given snacks in cooperation with the instructions provided. On Saturday nights, children K5 through fifth grade will receive a snack between Kids Church and Life Group hours. All snacks will be posted at the check in desks in the Kids area.
          </p>
          <h3>WHERE CAN I FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES?</h3>
          <p>
            It’s not easy to condense what we’re all about into a few frequently asked questions. For that reason, we have developed the Brainerd Preschool Handbook to provide you with all of the little details. Hard copies are available at the preschool check-in desk.
